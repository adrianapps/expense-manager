# Expense Manager

Expense Manager is a simple application for managing user's expenses, built using the MVC pattern.
The project provides two distinct interfaces to interact with: a Text User Interface (TUI) and a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). Both interfaces share the same core logic and use the same underlying model and controller.

## TUI built with Textual
